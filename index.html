      <p>
        In 1767 an engraver and mapmaker named
        <strong>John Spilsbury</strong> is credited with inventing the first
        <span class="puzzle">Jigsaw Puzzle</span>. They were created for
        teaching geography. Early jigsaws were known as dissections, they were
        produced by mounting maps on sheets of hardwood and cutting along
        national boundaries. <br />
        In the late 1800's cardboard
        <span class="puzzle">jigsaw puzzle</span> started to appear but were
        slowly replaced with wooden jigsaw due to the manufacture. Most modern
        <span class="puzzle">jigsaw puzzles</span> are made out of paperboard
        since they are easier and cheaper to mass-produce. A puzzle die is a
        flat board, often made from plywood, which has slots cut or burned in
        the same shape as the knives that are used. New technology has enabled
        laser-cutting of wooden or acrylic
        <span class="puzzle">jigsaw puzzles</span>. With the advantage of using
        a laser, puzzles can be custom cut into any size, shape and number of
        pieces.<br />
        Durning the Great Depression in 1929, puzzles experienced a huge surge
        of popularity. American companies began mass-producing puzzles out of
        cardboard. This reduced the cost drastically, durning a time when most
        families could not afford expensive activities, jigsaws provided a
        family fun. <br />
        There has been another surge of
        <span class="puzzle">jigsaw puzzles</span> during the Covid-19 pandemic
        with stay at home orders, that can be comparable to that of the Great
        Depression.

        According to the <strong>Alzheimer Society of Canada</strong>, doing
        <span class="puzzle">jigsaw puzzles</span> is one of the many activites
        that can help keep the brain active and may contribute to reducing the
        risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.
